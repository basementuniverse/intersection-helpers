Detecting whether two polygons intersect or one completely encloses the other can be approached using computational geometry algorithms. Here are some common methods:

1. Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)
SAT is a common algorithm for collision detection between convex polygons. It checks whether there exists an axis along which the projections of the two polygons do not overlap. If such an axis exists, the polygons do not intersect.
For concave polygons, you can first decompose them into convex polygons (using algorithms like ear clipping or triangulation) and then apply SAT to each pair of convex polygons.
2. Point-in-Polygon Test
To check if one polygon completely encloses another:
Test if all vertices of one polygon lie inside the other using a point-in-polygon algorithm (e.g., ray-casting or winding number method).
If any vertex of one polygon lies outside the other, it cannot be completely enclosed.
3. Edge Intersection Test
Check if any edge of one polygon intersects with any edge of the other polygon. If there is an intersection, the polygons overlap.
For concave polygons, this method works directly without decomposition.
4. Bounding Box Optimization
Compute the bounding boxes of the polygons first. If the bounding boxes do not overlap, the polygons cannot intersect. This is a quick pre-check to optimize performance.
5. Sweep Line Algorithm
For efficient intersection detection, you can use a sweep line algorithm to detect edge intersections. This is particularly useful for polygons with many edges.
6. Boolean Operations on Polygons
Libraries like Clipper or CGAL provide robust implementations for polygon intersection and containment checks. These libraries use advanced algorithms to handle edge cases and precision issues.
Suggested Approach:
For concave polygons:

Decompose them into convex polygons.
Use SAT for intersection detection.
Combine with point-in-polygon tests for containment checks.
