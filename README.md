# Intersection Helpers

A collection of helper functions for detecting intersections between various geometric shapes in 2D and 3D.

This library is not intended to be a full collision detection system - if you need that, I'd highly recommend [detect-collisions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-collisions).

Uses [poly-decomp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poly-decomp) for 2D polygon decomposition.

## How to install

```bash
npm install @basementuniverse/intersection-helpers
```

## How to use

## General-purpose utility functions

## 2D geometry

## 3D geometry
